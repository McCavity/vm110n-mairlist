Idea: read initial config from .ini file
- would happen in OnLoad (or rather: Init, which can be called from OnLoad as well as Main())
- check if natively support / could be extended by way of a unit:
  - check for "SWAG" archive
  - check those links:

Idea: use inputs for testing:
- use a config variable testmode=all|single
  - for testmode = all: shortpress on input switches all outputs to the same pattern
    1.: continuous
    2.: slow_blink (1 Hz)
    3.: fast_blink (2 Hz)
    4.: alt_blink (alternate slow and fast)
    5.: off
  - for testmode = single: shortpress on each input toggles the corresponding output through the patterns (see above)
  - longpress: >3 sec on any input toggles testmode between "single" and "all" and resets all outputs
    - indicate "all" by switching all outputs on for 1 s
    - indicate "single" by cycling through all outputs for 200 ms each
  
Idea: if using multiple scripts you can exchange strings between modules:
- Module A: SetRuntimeData(Key, Value: string);
- Module B: GetRuntimeData(Key);
  - Alternative: watch for changes:
    procedure OnRuntimeDataChange(Key, Value: string);
    begin
    end;
    
Idea: use custom mAirlist commands as triggers
- OnExecuteCommand (siehe 2. Teil des Posts): https://community.mairlist.com/t/gelost-k8055-script-talktimer-mit-rotlichtsteuerung/11435/4
